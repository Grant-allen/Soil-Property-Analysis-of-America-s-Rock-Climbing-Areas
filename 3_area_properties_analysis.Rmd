This project used data from [Mountain Project]("https://www.mountainproject.com/") and [UC Davis' Soil Database]("https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soil-properties/").
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

Importing the data and necessary libraries.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
df <- read.csv("2_cleaned_area_properties.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer) #Added to utilize the Dark2 color palette (colorblind friendly)
library(tidyr)

#### Data for analysis questions 1,2, and 3: analysis questions regarding soil properties specific to climbing areas.
After creating the charts, I save an image so I can make a grid of all charts to be displayed at the end.
These charts and analysis questions will be discussed in greater depth in the project report

##### Soil Properties Chart Collection
After plotting each soil property and saving the charts I created an image of all 8 charts for easy viewing and comparison.

#### Data for analysis question 4: Does the type of climbing differ between West, Central, and Eastern regions?
First, I make smaller data frames for climbing areas from each region
```{r}
west <- subset(df, state %in% c("California", "Nevada", "Colorado", "Oregon", "Utah"))
central <- subset(df, state == "Kentucky")
east <- subset(df, state == "New York")
```

Next, I aggregate the number of routes for each type of climbing in each region and divide by the total number of climbs in that region to obtain a percentage that is comparable with other regions
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
trad <- sum(west$trad_climbs)
sport <- sum(west$sport_climbs)
toprope <- sum(west$toprope_climbs)
boulder <- sum(west$boulder_climbs)
ice <- sum(west$ice_climbs)
aid <- sum(west$aid_climbs)
mixed <- sum(west$mixed_climbs)
alpine <- sum(west$alpine_climbs)
west_totals <- data.frame(trad, sport, toprope, boulder, ice, aid, mixed, alpine)

#make the data frame long instead of wide for easier plotting
west_totals <- gather(west_totals, key="Category", value = "Total")

#make a percentage column
west_totals$percentage <- west_totals$Total / sum(west_totals$Total) * 100

#make the pie chart
ggplot(west_totals, aes(x = 1, y = percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(title = "Trad and sport are the most abundant climbs in the West region", fill = "Type of Climb") +
  geom_text(data = subset(west_totals, percentage > 20),
            aes(label = paste0(Category, "\n", round(percentage, 1), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.75),
            color = "white",
            size = 4)
ggsave("west.png")


#same process for central

alpine <- sum(central$alpine_climbs)
central_totals <- data.frame(trad, sport, toprope, boulder, ice, aid, mixed, alpine)

central_totals <- gather(central_totals, key="Category", value = "Total")

central_totals$percentage <- central_totals$Total / sum(central_totals$Total) * 100

ggplot(central_totals, aes(x = 1, y = percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, color = "white") +

  geom_text(data = subset(central_totals, percentage > 20),
            aes(label = paste0(Category, "\n", round(percentage, 1), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.75),
            color = "white",
            size = 4)
